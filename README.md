## Programming in Haskell
My study notes for G51PGP: Programming Paradigm in ungrad1
This book introduces basics of functional programming. FP is a branch of declarative programming paradigm, which expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow as constrast to imperative programming. Functional codes describe **what** the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe **how** to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives.
Highlights:
- Variables in Haskell are **immutable** to avoid changing-state.
- GHC is noted for its high-performance implementation of concurrency and parallelism.
