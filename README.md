## Programming in Haskell

My study notes for G51PGP: Programming Paradigm in ungrad1. Haskell is a purely functional language that allows programmers to rapidly develop software that is clear, concise and correct. This book is divided into two parts:  

- Part 1 introduces the basic concepts and core features  
- Part 2 covers impure programming and more advanced topics 

Functional programming is a branch of declarative programming paradigm, which expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow as constrast to imperative programming. Functional codes describe **what** the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe **how** to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives.  

Highlights:

- Variables in Haskell are **immutable** to avoid changing-state.
- GHC is noted for its high-performance implementation of concurrency and parallelism.
